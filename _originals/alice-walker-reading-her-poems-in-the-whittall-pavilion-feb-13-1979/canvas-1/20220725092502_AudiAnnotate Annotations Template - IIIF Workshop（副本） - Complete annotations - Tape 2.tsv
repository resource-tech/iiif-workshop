6	23	Walker says she had never heard of Whoopi Goldberg before a friend of her then-partner Robert Allen told her to see Goldberg perform at the Rose Theater.	Speaker
23	38	Gussow and Walker seem to speculate that Goldberg read <em>The Color Purple</em> well before being cast in the film adaptation.	Speaker
113	131	On writing about taboo subjects: "It's about libertation for me. It's about seeing an area in which people are not free and, having such a strong instinct for freedom and wanting people to have it, that it's almost unbearable to know someone's not having at least the possibility."	Speaker
152	162	"Did you know that the first woman, Black woman, African woman in South Africa who publicly declared that she had AIDS was stoned to death by her community?"	Speaker
162	284	Walker continues discussing the South African woman who was killed (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/28/world/neighbors-kill-an-hiv-positive-aids-activist-in-south-africa.html">Gugu Dlamini</a>) before saying ultimately she doesn't yet know if this is something she should write about.)	Speaker
248	284	"I really do get it, that I've been given something really precious. I have to wait. I have to wait until I really know that it's time to use it. I can't just—and when it's clear that this is for me to do, then I can act."	Speaker
245		Walker sighs.	Speaker
306		Walker groans.	Speaker
308	336	Walker says the "most painful" example of people using her is when she is asked to endorse or give blurbs for books: "Sometimes I feel it's just too much. I can't read all the books. I can't see all the films. I can't respond to all the requests for whatever."	Speaker
366	353	Walker explains that she replaced a very "accommodating" assistant with one who was better able to reject external requests.	Speaker
396	424	Walker says she has "such admiration" for Oprah Winfrey.	Speaker
430	447	Walker explains that this interview is part of her book tour (for <em>The Way Forward Is with a Broken Heart</em>). She says she'll do a reading at Barnes and Noble later that evening and then move on to Boston, Seattle, Portland, Los Angeles, and then to the South.	Speaker
450	458	Walker says she hasn't decided yet what she'll read at her reading that evening: "I've just got to wait until I get there and I feel how it feels. Then I'll know."	Speaker
462		Walker laughs.	Speaker
468	472	When asked if you can always "trust the moment", Walker says: "Well, it's the only thing you have."	Speaker
475	637	Gussow suggests someone could ask a "very offensive question" at the reading, and Walker talks about how she responds in situations like that. She's unable to recall any specific instances when this happened, but says the "sting of the hostility" is lessened by her feelings of being aligned with her own principles.	Speaker
528	532	Walker orders a chamomile tea.	Speaker
566		Walker sighs.	Speaker
491		Walker laughs.	Speaker
494		Walker laughs.	Speaker
647	652	On people who ask why she doesn't write "another <em>The Color Purple</em>": "Oh good grief. Why? That's like saying, 'why don't you have another child?' One is plenty."	Speaker
662		Walker discusses her critics: "most of what they say is so superficial and boring, and it's not about what I'm writing about." She does say she enjoys reading good criticism of her work, including that by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deborah_E._McDowell">Deborah McDowell</a>.	Speaker
710	723	"I don't think critics can help me. I really don't. I feel like I'm really doing the best I can do with what I see my job here to be."	Speaker
730	753	Walker says her "ancestors really like" the way she does her work—and they are "tougher on [her] than critics are. Much."	Speaker
739		Walker laughs.	Speaker
770	810	"I feel very much accountable to literal ancestors, people who have been dead for however long they've been dead. And that to maintain the connection that I feel with them, I have to maintain a certain level of, I don't know, commitment, fidelity, truth."	Speaker
834		"How painful it is to realize that you're just almost completely misunderstood."	Speaker
852		Walker laughs.	Speaker
834	975	Walker discusses how criticism claiming she hates Black men or that her writing mistreats Black men has led to her being "cut off from a generation of young Black men": And I think this is a tragedy because reading me could've helped them. And I know it."	Speaker
948	975	Walker mentions her support for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumia_Abu-Jamal">Mumia Abu-Jamal</a> and theorizes it has helped repair her image for Black men.	Speaker
990		Walker says she did not watch the debate last night (presumably <a href="https://www.debates.org/voter-education/debate-transcripts/october-11-2000-debate-transcript/">the presidential debate</a>).	Speaker
1024		Walker calls George W. Bush "a madman" for his stance on the death penalty.	Speaker
1046		Walker expresses support for Green Party candidates Ralph Nader and Winona LaDuke to be "heard".	Speaker
1073	1090	"Imagine what it would be like, just to have ideas that are different and views that are different... and we're desperate for it. We deserve better. We deserve to hear all kinds of views. We're very varied as a country."	Speaker
1092		Walker makes a sound of frustration.	Speaker
1098	1139	Walker continues voicing support for Ralph Nader.	Speaker
1141		"All those people who really think we're living in a democracy!"	Speaker
1151		Walker expresses some support for Al Gore.	Speaker
1185	1210	On being interrupted by a fan: "I get it often; I'm so glad—I love to see—I even feel like I can identify, maybe it's just because they come up to me, but sometimes I feel I can tell the people who've read my work because they seem a little freer. They seem a little less burdened by the crap. And I like that."	Speaker
1252		Gussow brings up another interview Walker gave to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleanor_Wachtel">Eleanor Wachtel</a>.	Speaker
1289	1302	"Many people are unable to face their identity, especially as it changes. It's not fixed; it changes. So you're asked to continually reassess what it is."	Speaker
1305	1364	When asked to describe herself: "Well, a few of the things I know about myself is that I'm tri-racial—African American, Native American, and Euro, you know the Scotch-Irish part—probably tri-spiritual as well. I was raised as a Christian and now I love Buddhism and I love earth religion... and I also love both women and men. And trees."	Speaker
1364		Walker laughs.	Speaker
1378	1397	"I think one of the reasons that I love Buddhism is because one of its primary observations is that there is no self... we think there's a self... what you think of as yourself is always changing."	Speaker
1406	1418	"The way other people see you, the way they need to classify you—people, unfortunately, just get stuck there, trying to pin down something that's really always moving."	Speaker
1426		"I love watching myself change."	Speaker
1438	1500	Walker describes the significance of dreams as a signal to expand or grow: "You will start to dream about houses, and you'll be in a house, and suddenly you'll go through a door and there'll be a couple rooms you never knew you had in your house."	Speaker
1466		Walker laughs.	Speaker
1481		Walker insists her dream interpretations are not Freudian.	Speaker
1506		Walker laughs.	Speaker
1583		Walker shares that she is reading a book by her "dharma teacher" Jack Kornfield (<em>After the Ecstasy, the Laundry</em>).	Speaker
1599		Walker laughs.	Speaker
1626	1636	Walker confirms that she sent her ex-husband a copy of <em>The Way Forward Is with a Broken Heart</em> before it was published: "He loved it. Poor thing."	Speaker
1637		Walker laughs.	Speaker
1658	1735	Walker explains that both her marriage and her friendship with her ex-husband ended—"and that's the hard part."	Speaker
1675		"When we were married, his mother sat shiva."	Speaker
1740		Walker sighs.	Speaker
1762	1783	Walker says that her ex-husband adopted the speaking mannerisms of Mississippians.	Speaker
1790	1818	Walker briefly talks about her time at Sarah Lawrence College and how it was good for her writing to be among writers but isolating and difficult as a poor student.	Speaker
1858		Walker agrees to sign a book for Gussow.	Speaker
1908	2002	Gussow and Walker discuss a book Gussow published recently, <em>Edward Albee: A Singular Journey</em>.	Speaker
2000		Walker confesses to being misunderstood by her family in childhood.	Speaker
2015		Walker says she'll look for Gussow's book because she would like to read it.	Speaker
2018	2042	Walker and Gussow continue discussing Edward Albee and his work.	Speaker
2043	2062	Walker expresses that she "tend[s] to be more trusting of" work that has more of a basis in the author's biographic circumstances.	Speaker
2062	2110	"It really is entrusted to you. I often marvel at the fact that I, coming from this little place in the countryside of Georgia, should actually end up at Sarah Lawrence as the place where I would start learning my craft. How is that? Surely I'm then expected by somebody who's all around me to do something wtih that. Not to honor this passage, gosh, I don't think I would've made it."	Speaker
2113	2295	Walker compares Sarah Lawrence and Spelman: "At Sarah Lawrence with Muriel Rukeyser, Jane Cooper, and all those people... it just felt more like home in that way. And they weren't afraid of my strangeness, whatever it was."	Speaker
2205	2218	"When I got to Sarah Lawrence, I realized everyone was already really what they were going to be. The painters were painting, the writers were writing, the dancers were dancing, the singers were singing."	Speaker
2232	2285	Walker describes her relaitonship with Muriel Rukeyser.	Speaker
2308		"Well I enjoyed this very much more than I thought I would."	Speaker
2311		Walker laughs.	Speaker
2331		Walker mentions her experience interviewing Coretta Scott King after the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. She recalls that her recorder didn't work and that she also inadvertently offended King by asking about her husband's talent at dancing.	Speaker
2340		Walker sighs.	Speaker
2420	2460	Gussow tells Walker about a recently published book, <em>Einstein in Love</em>, which details his many romantic relationships: "Now we know why his hair was always messed up."	Speaker
2455		Walker laughs.	Speaker
2471		Gussow stops the recording abruptly.	Technology
504	534	The waiter offers coffee, tea, or dessert.	Environment
982		Gussow asks for the check.	Environment
981	990	A clattering suggests the coffee and tea have arrived and are being handled.	Environment
1160	1185	A fan interrupts to tell Walker that her how much she values her story "To Hell With Dying".	Environment
1820		Gussow thanks the waiter, who perhaps has dropped off the check.	Environment
1824	1855	Faint rustling of paper.	Environment
1862	1875	The sounds of Walker opening and signing a book for Gussow.	Environment
